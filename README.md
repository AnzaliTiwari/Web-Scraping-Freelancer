# Web-Scraping-Freelancer
This project is Intermediate level project for Web Scraping.
I have used python and some libraries like( Beautifulsoup, Selenium) to pull out data from the site called freelancers.com
Using this python script , one can scrape out data from any demographic,and can use any skill filter to pull out the information of a particular profile.
Suppose you want a data of some potential freelance who are good in python, you just have to run the code mentioning the skill only one time. it will pull the number of profiles you want to fetch out in a beautiful way, and that data will be collected in a proper manner in an EXCEL sheet automatically.
further that sheet can be used for analysis.
